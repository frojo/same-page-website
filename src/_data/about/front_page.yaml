    — a motto we’ve had since the beginning: highlighting the cohesion, chemistry, and communication it takes to be successful on set. Same Page Films is a full-service video production house founded by Temi Okotieuro and Alex Eaker, two Brooklyn-based filmmakers with a passion for film, art, jazz, fashion, and sports.

  Small footprint, big impact productions with the vision of creating one-of-one films that stand out.
